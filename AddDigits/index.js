/**
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:

Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

var addDigits = function(num) {
  return (num % 9 === 0 && num !== 0) ? 9 : num % 9
